Project Description, objectives and proposed outcomes: The proposed project is a large-scale randomized control study of 60 schools all of whom have committed interest in implementing the MicroSociety situated learning environment to validate the capacity of the model to increase student achievement and prepare students, by the end of 8th grade, for a pathway of success in college and beyond. The project will specifically: (1) Produce student outcomes in 8th grade that indicate a statistically significant higher degree of college and career readiness than a control group with an effect size > .30. (2) Create 30 new situated learning middle school environments (MicroSociety) leading to high student engagement and prove that this was a causal factor in goal #1 using a Randomized Control Trial (RCT) design. (3) Assist states in their transition to further refine their college and career readiness standards by identifying a key strategy - the use of a situated learning environment - to achieve these standards. The total number of students to be served by this project is 67,500 in states represented by key LEA partners listed above.

Program Model for Improving Children's Literacy Skills,Minneapolis,MN,55418,"""A Chance To Grow (ACTG) requests a Developmental Grant for SMART   a school-based intervention that promotes brain stem functioning and improves learning capacities in young children.  SMART has demonstrated that it can produce reading gains and close achievement gaps between students of different income and racial groups.  In i3, ACTG will expand SMART to 30 schools in three states.  SMART has two overarching objectives: (1) the SMART curriculum, along with ongoing mentoring, will produce greater teacher effectiveness, and (2) more effective teachers will result in greater student achievement and growth and a reduction in achievement gaps between groups of students.  SMART is a teacher development approach that provides elementary teachers with a tool kit (SMART curriculum) that facilitates early learning, promotes movement, and provides ongoing forums for teachers to address classroom leadership issues into 30 schools in three states.  SMART is designed to be integrated into the daily classroom schedule and administered by regular teachers.  ACTG provides a week-long summer training in SMART curriculum, how to integrate SMART into the daily classroom, and, training in learner-centered approaches and classroom leadership skills.  SMART also provides to teachers up to three years of mentoring from former educators trained in SMART and learner-centered approaches.  7,500 to 10,000 students will be involved over a period of five years. Using University of Denver's experimental research design, reading tests will be used to assess reading levels and gains in phonemic awareness, phonics, vocabulary, fluency, and comprehension. Teacher effectiveness will be measured by classroom observations and teacher, parent, and student surveys.  Official partners are the University of Denver and the 30 participating LEA schools in MN, SD, and WI.""",AP1: Effective Teachers and Principals,CP5: Early Learning,Nonprofit w/ consortium of schools,Development,5 years,4993905,No,"Minneapolis, MN

Admission Possible,Admission Possible College Access Program,Saint Paul,MN,55104,"""Admission Possible, partnering with Milwaukee Public Schools and five schools in the Twin Cities, seeks a Development Grant of $5 million to support the growth of our program to serve nearly 12,000 students over the next 5 years. This effort will serve low-income high school students as they prepare for and earn admission to college by providing test preparation services, college application support, help with financial aid and scholarships, and guidance in the college transition. Over the past 10 years, our students have seen ACT score increases of more than 20%; 98% have been admitted to college; and more than 80% of our college students remain enrolled in college or have earned their degree. Our key innovation is using a national service model to increase college access; this approach allows us to provide intensive services at a low cost that makes it scaleable. Last June, President Obama commended our work by stating, 'Admission Possible operates in just two states now.  So imagine if it was 10, or 20, or 50.' This grant would support growth of our innovative program to serve additional students in the Twin Cities, Milwaukee, and a third site. A random assignment evaluation will be used to demonstrate the program's effectiveness; funding for the evaluation has been identified and the evaluator, Dr. Chris Avery of Harvard Kennedy School, has been secured. As an AmeriCorps program, Admission Possible has raised $4 of private sector support for each federal dollar awarded and a history of sustainable growth. Our record of success, ability to leverage private funds, and singular focus on the important national goal of college access lead us to seek this federal support to expand our efforts to serve many more of the 200,000 low-income high school students who could go to college every year, but don't.

The system will also allow for the acquisition and implementation of an instructional improvement system that allows teachers to create common and formative assessments which will be used to identify potentially high risk students.  A data coach will be employed at each school in the district to provide job embedded professional development for teachers.  The data coaches and principals will provide differentiated professional development to teachers based on observation data based on Robert Marzano's 41 key strategies related to effective teaching. The electronic platform, iObservation, will collect, manage, and report data for instructional leaders and teachers to make informed decisions.  Data coaches will model effective instructional strategies based on the data collected during classroom walkthroughs.

RAP Scholars was initiated with the goal of decreasing the documented achievement gap between Caucasian students and their African American and Hispanic counterparts. This program is offered to economically disadvantaged/underserved 8th grade students and African American and Hispanic students (who do not fall under the economic category) who are transitioning to one of the three Ann Arbor High Schools and who, through grade point averages and test scores, have shown academic promise.The RAP Scholars program has three main goals: 1) to address achievement disparities by Raising the Academic Performance (RAP) of under-served but high achieving students; 2) to enroll selected students into accelerated (AC) and advanced placement (AP) courses and receive a score of 4 or 5 on the AP exams; and 3) to academically prepare and enroll these students into top ranked college and universities. The RAP Scholars are divided into cohorts of 20-25 and will remain in those cohorts with a trained University of Michigan college student mentor. The mentor will provide in-depth one-on-one guidance through their learning experiences inside and outside the classroom until graduation (estimate 585 RAP Scholars over the project duration with 585 in the comparison group a total N= 1,170).

These world-renowned investigators encourage us to ponder big questions that may eventually lead us to big discoveries.QUEST will develop, implement, evaluate and refine 10 multi-media modules, as well as evaluate the effectiveness of the Cycle Q instructional model that has big questions as its central core.  Each module will focus on a different big question theme, such as ?Is there life on other planets??  QUEST module development teams will consist of middle school teachers and their classes, Origins? scientists and graduate researchers, and science education specialists.  Additionally, this project will involve an extensive evaluation team and a technology development team to create interactive computer simulations, videos and other multi-media components for the QUEST modules.  QUEST is a collaborative project between Arizona State University (including the College of Teacher Education and Leadership (CTEL), the Origins Initiative and the Technology Based Learning and Research Center), Pendergast Elementary School District and Madison Elementary School District.

Our expected outcomes are: (1) Produce fifty-five curriculum units with embedded performance assessment tasks across the core content areas in grades 6, 7 and 8 that build deep literacy and numeracy skills while systematically developing critical thinking, metacognitive skills and global competence; (2) Generate quantitative and qualitative evidence of implementation of Project and demonstrable  improvements in performance, critical thinking skills, motivation, and cultural competence; and (3) Produce and disseminate digital tools, resources, and a professional development regimen that can be used at scale in varied contexts.The Project will pilot in Asia Society's International Studies Schools Network (ISSN) and will be implemented in 6 existing or new ISSN schools: 3 schools in two urban school districts (Denver and New York City), 1 charter school (Philadelphia), and two rural schools (Texas and Mississippi).""",AP3: High Standards and High-Quality Assessments,"CP6: College Access and Success College Access and Success, CP8: Rural LEAs",Nonprofit w/ consortium of schools,Development,4 years,4296907,No,"New York, NY

The CBP aligns the curriculum to systematically reflect the state standards, matches assessments to curriculum, and provides data to inform decisions regarding the delivery and realignment of instruction. Though benchmark systems are typically authentic, timely and relevant, we have noted that they lack the rigor and the reflective diagnostic nature that results in teachers knowing what to teach with the means to assess and maintain the instructional assessment cycle: the hallmark of our innovation.	This process, when implemented in math over a four-year period, resulted in increased student achievement and teacher performance and productivity in the delivery of the content. It is the district's hypothesis that the CBP system can be replicated into other content areas.  Students have been unsuccessful in their ability to demonstrate LAL content knowledge on high stakes tests even though a strong professional development framework for teaching LAL exists. To this end, we propose to apply the model in LAL to close the achievement gap for all students.Since our District fits the grant description of a high-needs student population, it is our position that when students make consistent gains and the gap closes, they will have greater opportunities for college access and success, affirming, 'an informed populace will have an opportunity to enhance their lives and the society in which they live' (Doctor, 1994).The District will build upon the promising results from the math CBP to expand this process to our early learners as the focus has previously been on students in grades 3-8.

Those identified as at-risk have significantly lower graduation rates than the general student population, despite concerted efforts to address their challenges. This proposal addresses the need to know what interventions are most successful with at-risk students, what interventions are most effective within different subgroups, and the need to design a District-wide system to ensure that no student will fall through the cracks while enrolled in AISD. We believe the solution to these needs lies in designing an Advanced Case Management system with automated workflow and analytic capabilities to manage resource allocation, provide status and exception reports, and track interventions (both AISD-driven and those provided by community partners) longitudinally to establish efficacy. This proposal will marry our current Impact system, which requires an in-depth analysis of the challenges facing individual at-risk students, with our Youth Services Mapping, which provides educators with the academic, social, and emotional services available for at-risk youth. Students can thereby be matched with the most effective services to meet their needs and their progress can be tracked through school and through the service providers.With i3 funds, AISD will address these barriers to full implementation, developing an enhanced early intervention process for at-risk students within the District, by working with International Business Machines (IBM) to develop an Advanced Case Management (ACM) solution.

Baltimore City Public Schools (City Schools) believes that parents have an essential role to play in this process: there is clear and extensive evidence from published research that parental involvement and engagement in a child's education are factors that are strongly associated with higher academic performance. In order to support their children's schooling, however, parents themselves need a good understanding of the educational process and what types of help and support their children need in order to successfully complete each stage. Living in overwhelmingly income-segregated neighborhoods, many of City Schools families have very few - if any - people anywhere in their social network who have successfully navigated all stages of this path. The purpose of this project is to remove this fundamental roadblock to improving academic achievement among the children and young people of Baltimore by ensuring that all parents within the City are provided with the information, resources and support needed to understand and effectively engage with every stage of their children's education. This project holds an ambitious set of expectations about what parents hope for their children and what they can contribute concretely to their children's success in school.

The School Quality Review provides the means for City Schools to capture the qualitative essence of good teaching and leadership by conducting a two-day visit using trained reviewers and a protocol aligned to research-based practices. Through the implementation of the SQR next year (SY 2010-2011), City Schools will (1) measure a school's quality of instructional and operational activities, and (2) transform its efforts in strategically supporting the needs of schools through intense action planning and monitoring. This proposal seeks funds to support the execution of the School Quality Review. The SQR gathers specific information at the school level and addresses the following priorities: 1.	Define quality of instruction, management, support, and culture within the Baltimore context;2.	Measure the degree to which these schools exhibit the qualities expected by City Schools;3.	Develop a performance management system for schools that will have them create action plans linking priorities to measurable outcomes; and 4.

Baltimore City Public Schools,Baltimore Career Ladder,Baltimore,MD,21202,"""The hallmark of an educational system is the academic achievement of its students.  A growing body of research strongly suggests that an essential component of student achievement is sustained access to highly-effective teachers. Effective teachers do not necessarily have the most years in the classroom or the most advanced degrees listed after their names.  Instead, they share their passion for the education process with their students, facilitating the students' success both in the classroom and based on standardized measures.Effective teachers must be developed and nurtured along their professional journey.  It is incumbent on City Schools to enhance their competencies, cultivate their abilities to share their skills with peers, and constantly rekindle their passion for teaching.  Effective teachers who demonstrate all these qualities are in the best position to promote the academic success of City Schools students and so must be compensated fairly-even richly-for City Schools to attract and retain them.City Schools currently is working to change that in a revolutionary way.  City Schools will apply funds from the i3 Development Grant to the creation of the Career Ladder, a comprehensive professional development and compensation framework supported by multilayered, interconnected data systems that track the direct effect of professional development activities on student achievement.  The Career Ladder will benefit not only the ways by which City Schools rewards highly effective teachers, it also will have data-driven applications across and beyond the City Schools system-from tracking student achievements and shortcomings, to developing new opportunities for teacher enrichment, to partnering City Schools students with area businesses for real-world internship and learning opportunities.""",AP1: Effective Teachers and Principals,"CP5: Early Learning, CP6: College Access and Success College Access and Success, CP7: Unique Learning Needs",LEA,Development,3 years,5089782,Yes,"Baltimore, MD

The Intercollegiate Studies Institute in its third report on civic literacy, Our Fading Heritage noted 'There is an epidemic of historical, political and economic ignorance in America'. In underserved communities, the problem is even more serious, as alienation from the civic process infects general academic performance, even as a growing body of research shows that engaging students on their values and aspirations can have dramatic impacts on overall grades and test scores.  Respected sources put the costs of these achievement gaps at $400-700 billion per year to our economy. Current programs do not address the unique developmental needs and interests of middle-school students, nor do they engage teachers who have a limited knowledge of history or the core values of our democracy. Middle school is an appropriate time to introduce students to the knowledge, skills, and attitudes that are essential to the functioning of a democratic society. The Barat Education Foundation has worked with a team of educators and technology specialists to develop a 21st century media-rich model to teach civics and citizenship to middle school students: Our American Voice (OAV).

These Academic Coaches work in small groups, using research-based materials and strategies that focus on building the self-esteem, engagement, and self-awareness that best support student learning. While the specific schedules for these coaching sessions are organized at the discretion of the individual schools, the supplemental nature of each program, and the fact that students are identified using multiple data sources, including local and nationally normed assessments, mean that this project can serve as part of a Tier II Response to Intervention model.	The goals of this program are: 1) to ensure that elementary students meet grade level expectations in math and English as measured using both local and state assessment tools, 2) to increase the growth rate for student performance as measured using state assessments, 3) to support students from traditionally under-performing subgroups as they take on the challenge of more advanced classes.

BPL will employ its school design--currently employed in 70 BPL schools throughout the US--in creating in Tulsa a comprehensive K-12 system of innovative alternative schools that are open to all students within the district. BPL schools consistently achieve significant gains in attendance, deep engagement, behavior, and performance on a variety of standardized and non-traditional measures. This i3 project will permit BPL to go to the next level of rigor (validity and reliability) in outcome evaluation by undertaking a comprehensive and rigorous evaluation that provides valid and reliable information regarding the efficacy of the BPL design. 	By the end of the four-year project, BPL will implement its design in 17 schools and programs in the Tulsa Public Schools, serving approximately 3300 students and approximately 380 teachers in grades K-12. Our objective is to achieve statistically significant gains in student performance on such indicators as academic skills performance, college and career readiness skills, and college access, persistence, and success for those students participating in the turnaround initiative. During year four of the project, BPL will scale the project in three additional school districts (Brockton, Newark, and San Francisco).	BPL will provide professional development and in-school coaching to each of the schools and train and support TPS school coaches in order to institutionalize and expand the alternative system beyond the project period. The BPL support design will make extensive use of high quality online learning and related technology applications to support effective teaching within the BPL design.""",AP4: Persistently Low-Performing Schools,CP6: College Access and Success College Access and Success,Nonprofit w/ LEA,Development,4 years,4984584,No,"Providence, RI

BEST will provide Chicago elementary schools with professional development support and resources to impact school-wide literacy by building the school's own capacity to develop and support on-going, high quality professional development.  In effect, schools develop capacity for future instructional improvement at a new level of productivity and efficiency.  The ultimate beneficiaries are students who will have highly-qualified teachers working in an effective school environment each and every school year.  At demonstration and scale-up sites, teachers improve literacy instructional practices across the curriculum by: (1) attending summer institutes and workshops focused on research-based literacy best practices (2) assuming leadership roles by leading study groups, functioning as peer coaches, and collaborating with colleagues and their principals to set new directions for school reform in literacy and other content areas; and (3) participating in study groups, peer coaching, and reflective dialogue. Students engage in learning activities that improve their attitude about reading, improve their comprehension of text, and increase their standardized test scores.  Project objectives: (1) establish a system of collaboration among the partners; (2) increase teacher professional capacity in literacy instruction; (3) develop teacher leadership and collaboration to provide a sustainable infrastructure for continuous improvement and instructional change; (4) improve the academic outcomes of Northern Illinois students; (5) validate the BEST model at 10 demonstration site schools in Northern Illinois; and (6) scale-up the BEST model to schools, teachers, and students across Northern Illinois.""",AP4: Persistently Low-Performing Schools,,Nonprofit w/ consortium of schools,Development,5 years,4099456,No,"Chicago, IL

Enabling youth to successfully prepare for college is an enormous task that must be addressed in a comprehensive manner.  These efforts must begin long before high school.  To be truly successful, efforts should begin when a child enters kindergarten.  Approaching our final goal of attending college can be achieved by tracking this goal in reverse.  	In order to attend college, youth must graduate.  Graduating on time increases the likelihood they will attend college.  In order to graduate on time, youth need to succeed in school.  In order to succeed in school, they need to avoid at-risk behavior, attend school regularly and receive the educational support they need.  All of this must begin early and continue throughout high school.  The Boys & Girls Club of Cabarrus County recognizes these needs and responds with programs that benefit youth at each critical stage during their school years.   With the implementation of 'High School in 4 and Then More' we will take these efforts to a new level.  Youth are bombarded daily by negative influences that are specifically marketed to them.  We plan to use the power of marketing to make a positive impact on young people.  'High School in 4 and The More' will be introduced to youth from Kindergarten on as they join the Boys & Girls Club.  Posters will appear at our facilities and be distributed throughout the community.  Youth will receive t-shirts with this logo and the pledge 'I will graduate. Class of 20--.'  This will of course relate to their individual graduation year.

Boys & Girls Club of St. Joseph County, in collaboration with the South Bend Community School Corporation (LEA) and numerous community partners, will demonstrate how providing an innovative continuum of externally provided services, including early childhood interventions, will significantly improve the academic achievement of high need students in the identified persistently low-performing schools. Rather than working from the inside out - starting with the schools themselves - curriculum, professional development and programming - the Club is proposing that this project will work from the outside in - starting with the community and families, delivering the social supports necessary to address the critical - but often overlooked - barriers to education that exist for families living in poverty.  The services will target three critical developmental stages: birth through pre-school, Kindergarten through second grade, and third through eighth grade. This approach will rapidly and directly help the interventions by connecting the kids most at risk with the supports they need and allow programs to be more efficiently targeted so fewer kids fall through the cracks. While this process will benefit every student, the impact on students of color and students living in poverty will be especially profound. Children who are actively involved in programming will have significantly more optimal academic outcomes, as well as more positive rates of change over the course of the interventions, than children receiving more typical supports in the control schools.

Our approach has proven to be particularly effective for students with disabilities, approximately 20% of our student body.  We believe that the key to the success of our school model is the blending of our intensive arts education programming and collaborative co-teaching.  The integration of these two non-traditional instructional strategies allows us to use a variety of instructional practices and strategies to effectively meet the diverse needs of all individual learners in our underserved school community.  While this combination of practices has not been widely adopted or extensively evaluated, our student achievement results strongly suggest that an investment in the further development and systematic study of our innovative school model will demonstrate its potential to increase the success of under-represented students in academically rigorous courses.""",AP3: High Standards and High-Quality Assessments,CP7: Unique Learning Needs,LEA,Development,5 years,1847800,No,"Bronx, NY

Continued success will require our educational system to adopt modern methods and means to remain effective and relevant in a 21st century marked by innovation, knowledge, technology, and global competition.  The Promoting Higher Youth in Science through Interactive Computer Systems (PHYSICS) provides preparation for any type of postsecondary education that requires strong academic foundations without the need for academic remediation. PHYSICS is a program that enables students, teachers and schools to promote critical thinking skills. The PHYSICS program creates a discourse in the highest need area of science, physics and physical science. The need for Physics teachers is a national priority as teachers retire and fewer than 1:200 teachers are certified in Physics nationally. We focus on providing students the opportunity to first experience labs through simulations followed by work in the physical lab.  We believe this results in a significant improvement in long-term academic retention of knowledge and skills. To gain scientific literacy, students need to understand basic scientific concepts as well as the process that has been used to gain and refine such concepts over time. This means teachers need to be able to provide opportunities for students to participate in the complete practice of science and to ?support and engage active learners in the process of doing scientific inquiry.? (Barab and Leuhmann 2002, 445). The PHYSICS model targets a deeper understanding of the practices within science which allows teachers to more successfully conduct authentic experiences in their classrooms and help students build their own scientific habits of mind and critical thinking skills.

At the same time, Carteret County Schools recognizes the importance of promoting careers in science, math and engineering to strengthen student academic achievement, provide students with a career focus, strengthen partnerships with industry, revitalize the workforce, and help secure our future in Eastern North Carolina as well as nationally.Our goal is to provide engineering education to our high school students preparing them to major in engineering at the postsecondary level and return to our community to pursue engineering as a career.  In an effort to serve our students as well as our community, our objective is to establish a CTP Engineering Career Pathway at the high school level and an A.A.S. in Engineering degree at Carteret Community College.  Our strategy to accomplish our objective is to bring engineering into our schools by offering Project Lead the Way (PLTW.)   PLTW provides high tech, problem-solving based courses which will bring science, CTE, and technology education into the 21st Century as well as prepare our students for a career in engineering. As educators we understand that students will have more success with more exposure to curriculum therefore we would like to begin the initial program education rot  the student at the middle school level.  If we can engage middle school students in creatve problem based learning while teaching math, science and technology success is attainable.""",AP3: High Standards and High-Quality Assessments,"CP5: Early Learning, CP6: College Access and Success College Access and Success, CP7: Unique Learning Needs",LEA,Development,4 years,2859160,No,"Beaufort, NC

Algebra READY will serve students in grades 3-8 at 3 elementaries and 2 junior highs.Description and Unique Aspects: Algebra READY provides teachers the ability to synchronize instruction to the ongoing development of their students? needs throughout the year. By connecting formative assessment data with sophisticated conceptual grouping strategies and high quality digital investigations coupled with facilitated discourse, Algebra READY provides a comprehensive mathematics program, encouraging not only intervention but acceleration. Algebra READY begins by taking a snapshot of student mathematical understanding using a digital diagnostic tool. The diagnostic tool provides teachers a map of students? gradients of understanding across the continuum of critical benchmarks of algebra readiness. Software utilizes the map to ?intelligently sort? students, supporting teachers? flexible grouping of students according toindividual student needs. Teachers bring meaningful mathematics to the classroom using investigative lessons capitalizing on open source multimedia that engage and inspire students while encouraging mathematical discourse. The teachers act as facilitators rather than lecturers. Throughout the year, formative assessment spotlights students? understandings and misconceptions, making ?students? thinking visible? (NCTM, 2000). This provides teachers with next steps personalized to individual needs. All program features are delivered digitally through one-to-one netbooks, utilizing open source multimedia supported by a flexible digital platform.

The program's goals are to improve math achievement of high-needs students; increase math content knowledge among K-12 teachers; and increase the number of highly effective teachers entering the field.Anchoring the program are bi-weekly seminars among university faculty, secondary math teachers, and undergraduates. These seminars provide the forum for integrating mathematics content and pedagogy, for structuring early field experiences, and for enriching participants' mathematical understanding.  For example, in a seminar on mathematical misconceptions in algebra, participants analyze common wrong answers and discuss ways to help students understand how to avoid these errors.  Participants deepen their own understandings of the mechanics of algebra and discuss pedagogy.  Linked to the seminar is an early field experience: undergraduate participants tutor two hours a week with high-needs seventh, eighth and ninth graders in a two-hour 'Connections to Algebra' class. The seminar assists tutors by teaching them how to incorporate high-level mathematical thinking and pedagogy into the 'Connections' curriculum. To complete the circle, high school 'Connections' students are trained to themselves tutor second graders at nearby high-needs elementary schools.  This requires these struggling high school students to master mathematical concepts at a higher level. It also allows them to be a role model for the younger students. The basic structure of the program is in place at Chico High School in partnership with CSU,C.

Children's Literacy Initiative,Children,Philadelphia,PA,19103,"""Project Description: Children?s Literacy Initiative (CLI) created a teacher professional development program that includes three years of trainings, intensive coaching, high-quality instructional tools, and professional learning communities that help students reach the critical milestone of reading on grade level by the end of 3rd grade. CLI trains all K-3 teachers in a school in high-impact literacy instruction and establishes shared standards of practice; identifies, recruits, and develops one Model Classroom teacher per grade, who receives more intensive coaching and learning community support, preparing them to help colleagues master literacy standards of practice long after CLI?s intervention is complete; and ensures school leaders know how to leverage the Model Classroom to sustain and expand excellent literacy instruction. Research meeting criteria for moderate evidence shows that CLI has helped increase student achievement and close the gaps between high need students and peers. Project Objectives & Outcomes: CLI will demonstrate how its intervention can be taken to scale within a district and replicated regionally and across the country to improve student achievement, increase the number of highly effective teachers, use metrics to set standards of practice, and have a spillover effect that builds a school-wide culture of excellent literacy instruction. Target Number of Students: CLI will train 456 teachers in grades K-3 in 38 randomly-selected public schools in four districts in geographically distinct areas of the US, reaching 45,600 students during the five year grant period. Partners: CLI will work with Camden City Public Schools, Chicago Public Schools, Newark Public Schools, and the School District of Philadelphia.

Since beginning the SLC process in 2002, our high school has significantly narrowed achievement gaps, and increased the graduation rate, moving the high school from an Ohio rating of Academic Watch in 2004 to Effective in 2009. Moving School from a Noun to a Verb, an i3 Development Grant proposal, is designed to take personalized learning another step, providing access to technological tools and a learning platform 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by expanding our wireless network throughout the community. Every student will have free, safe access to the internet and the district?s network from their home or from any other part in the community. More than 3,400 students in grades 6-12 already have district-distributed laptops. Provision of laptops and access to the high speed wireless environment narrows the digital divide for our students, nearly three out of five of whom are economically disadvantaged and 80% of whom are minority (75% African American). Moving School from a Noun to a Verb will be implemented over a 3-year period for $1.25 per student per day.	CH-UH proposes to address Absolute Priority 3: to benchmark against the new Ohio Standards based on the national Common Core Standards following cohorts of students beginning with the 6th grade through their college career.

This proposal responds to Absolute Priority #3 and Competitive Priority #6, and is a Development Grant proposal. The proposed expansion of the SUCCESS Initiative (SI) is a collaborative program with a two-fold objective. The first objective is to increase the level of college readiness for targeted, at-risk 11th and 12th grade students (350 annually), using a case management model with college coaches embedded in seven target schools to provide daily support services through high school graduation. Coaches will then follow these students through their first 45 college credits. The second objective is to create a model for systemic change that will foster significant alignments between colleges and secondary schools, particularly in terms of aligned curricula, assessments and expectations, thus creating seamless transitions from one educational level to the other. The impact from both of these sets of services will be fewer students having to take developmental courses as incoming college freshmen. The outcome will be greater college graduation rates because students will be entering ?college ready.? The economy will benefit by having a skilled and educated workforce ready to move the country into the 21st century?s global economy. The Consortium has a 36-year history of providing educational access services across Massachusetts, and therefore is well positioned to work with the two public college partners, who tend to be the gateway into higher educaiuton for at-risk students.

Mathematical learning will be enhanced in this context via multiple pathways stemming from the implementation of the treatment (the integration of the games into the curricular/instructional environment of the classroom), namely:1.	Play of interactive games using research-based learning trajectories in all standards areas.2.	Enhancement of classroom instructional strategies due to teacher learning of said trajectories via professional development, training and mentoring3.	Individualization of game interactions, leading to optimal efficiency of learning, including student-specific activity levels, choice of language, and use of relevant themes.4.	Targeted actions by teachers and parents using student reports from the gaming software.The five-year project is based on two new developments: 1) current research in early mathematics learning and microdevelopment, early mathematics differences between socioeconomic (and other) groups, and their far-reaching effects on later educational outcomes, and 2) cutting-edge gaming software capabilities allowing unprecedented interactive flexibility and data-collection/reporting useful in formative assessment and differentiation or individualization of instruction.  Kids Play Math II is an extension (to grades K-1) of a current Office of Head Start-funded project creating such games for PreK with research-based supports for teachers and parents.

The Consortium has always held that learning is complex, and assessments should be, too.  This is no less true for students with high needs than for students from more privileged background. Instead of relying on standardized tests and the standardized teaching it produces, the Consortium has developed a system with required performance-based assessment tasks (PBATs) in English, social studies, science, and math. PBATs reflect the complexity of learning that Conley (2007) refers to in his work on college readiness-analyzing conflicting phenomena, supporting arguments with evidence, solving complex problems that have no obvious answer, and generally thinking deeply about what they are being taught.  These are the specific skills that Wagner (2008) argues are needed to prepare students for the 21st century.

College Preparatory Mathematics Educational Program (CPM) is proud to partner with teachersand administrators at five high schools in multiple states (WI, CA, ?) and evaluators at UC Davis on adevelopment grant for the RAISE-Math project. We will work with teachers and administrators to raise theachievement of students as we support schools transitioning their mathematics classrooms from teacher- tostudent-centered.Frequently, student-centered curricula have been implemented in hopes of changing teacher practice but thesuccess has been mixed; we propose instead to change practice prior to changing curriculum. First, teacherswill participate in professional development, including frequent coaching focused on student-centeredpractices. Each teacher will be coached once every two weeks while using the school?s standard curriculum.During the second year the student-centered CPM curriculum will be introduced with equally intensivecoaching and professional development. During the third year lead teachers from the school will be invited toattend coaching seminars allowing them to become coaches in their own districts. Throughout the project,administrators will participate in professional development aimed at understanding student-centeredclassrooms, supporting teachers and educating stakeholders.We expect several strongly favorable outcomes: participating teachers will become adept at teaching in astudent-centered way; students will demonstrate increased understanding of mathematics on state tests andproblem-based assessments; and significantly increased numbers of students will take additional mathematicsand science classes.

Project-based learning (PBL) will be the heart of this instructional approach. PBL uses technology and inquiry to engage students with issues and questions that are relevant to their lives. In these technology-based classrooms, teachers design rigorous projects aligned to state and district standards and customize them to their location and the interests of students. Students then work in teams to acquire and apply knowledge and skills to solve problems. This technological approach to PBL fundamentally changes the role of teacher and student.Project Goal:  Improve teacher and school leader effectiveness; increase student achievement.  This technologically based school model helps improve teacher and school leader effectiveness through neuroscience based professional development and educational hardware and software products. Students will be able to effectively assimilate their school curriculums, which in turn will enable them to stay in school, successfully graduate, and be adequately prepared for success in college and career.

Improve Academic Achievement",Washington,DC,20009,"""DC VOICE, and five partners (Alliance for Education, A+ Schools of Pittsburgh, Mobile Area Education Foundation, Bridgeport Public Education Fund, and Paterson Education Fund, collectively referred to as the ?Collaborative,? seeks funding to support an innovative six-city, community action research (CAR) program that addresses immediate and systemic barriers to student achievement and college and career readiness through coalition-building in traditionally marginalized communities. This program will develop methodology (for replication in other communities) tested in DC, which has lead to significant improvement in schools. CAR, as defined in this project, involves community volunteers in the collection of data affecting teaching and learning in public schools. The objectives are to: (1) implement the ?Ready Schools? and ?College Access andSuccess? projects; (2) improve these CAR efforts in each site; and (3) evaluate both the process and the outcomes across multiple years and all six sites to strengthen the evidence base and begin scaling up the process to other regions and States. The expected outcomes are: 1) the six sites will show significantly improved target outcomes; (2) all U.S. local education agencies (LEAs) will have access to tools, processes, and results via a web portal that will enable them to plan and implement effective action research in their own communities; and (3) a sufficient base of knowledge, data, and expertise to apply to a broader range of education reform issues. Key project features are: 1) community engagement capacity that can be appliedacross a multitude of needs; 2) the volunteer research component; 3) a web portal (uniquely interfacing with each user) to facilitate best practices, site-to-site technical assistance, volunteer management and training, research dissemination, and the ability for lay users to find meaningful information; and 4) the ability to test this model simultaneously across six cities.""",AP4: Persistently Low-Performing Schools,"CP6: College Access and Success College Access and Success, CP7: Unique Learning Needs, CP8: Rural LEAs",Nonprofit w/ consortium of schools,Development,3 years,3478510,No,"Washington, DC

Our hypothesis is the growth is directly attributed to use of a Coaching Model and the use of data to inform instruction (RTI). The process includes:1) using formative reading assessments from a state-adopted reading program to measure growth, 2) organizing/displaying data on a data wall, 3) use coach to facilitate data analysis meetings with teachers, and 4) teachers planning interventions for students to improve learning. The Coaching Model including the data wall process will be the core of the DNDATA Project. I3 funds will support fully implementing this successful Coaching Model that has shown high potential but has not been implemented district-wide. DN DATA will be an integrated assessment and intervention system that identifies students at risk of failure, monitors student progress, and provides evidenced-based interventions at multi-levels. The primary goal of the DN DATA Project is to implement data driven instruction in Pre-Kindergarten-12th grade classrooms using the Coaching Model in core subjects in all DNCUSD schools. A secondary goal of the DN DATA Project is to improve student performance and close the achievement gap between the subgroup and general student populations through promising practices of data analysis and coaching. DN DATA Project's first step will be to lay a foundation of professional development in Years 1 and 2 that will build a common knowledge base among administrators and teachers. PD will include a consultant Coach Trainer for ten teachers as full time coaches.

Supported by key organizational partners, DPPS will open 16 schools in Rhode Island's Blackstone Valley over the next 5 years.  As DPPS implements this growth strategy in Rhode Island-and as other emerging charter networks replicate nationwide-there is one key challenge to sustainable growth: the lack of school leaders ready and able to lead high-performing 'no excuses' schools.  To address this human capital shortage, DPPS and its applicant partners seek an i3 Development grant (under Absolute Priority I) to build an innovative new school leader training program-Leader U-that successfully identifies, recruits, develops, and rewards highly-effective school leaders to serve in Democracy Prep Public Schools and other Rhode Island public schools, thereby providing a scalable proof-point for a national approach to leadership development in education. In this application, DPPS proposes to: (1) Build Leader U as an academic program; (2) develop a school leader evaluation model for use statewide; and (3) conduct a rigorous evaluation of the impact of this programming and evaluation system on student achievement.  In so doing, DPPS will directly improve academic outcomes for 8,700 students, who will be enrolled in schools operated by Leader U fellows by 2016, and at least 100,000 more nationwide through dissemination of best practices and model replication assistance.

Our proposal seeks to pilot the use of the EXPLORE, PLAN and ACT as short-cycle assessments in order to adjust curriculum and instruction to increase the number and percentage of students who are prepared for college as defined by the benchmark scores set by the ACT in Reading, English, Math and Science.  While EMHS has met these benchmark scores on average in Reading and English, we have not yet in Math and Science.  Additionally, we have not yet met our goal of ensuring that each student meets the benchmark score in each subject.  Nationally, only 23% of students taking the ACT achieved the college readiness benchmark score in all four subject areas.  Achieving this score in all four subject areas would indicate that a student has a 75% probability of achieving a C or better and a 50% probability of achieving a B or better in a credit-bearing College English Composition, Algebra or Biology course. In addition to piloting the use of the EXPLORE, PLAN and ACT, East Mountain High School will work with Solution Tree to implement the strategies of Professional Learning Communities at Work, the Marzano Research Laboratory and McRel Research Laboratory to define essential course outlines, align curriculum to instructional activities and provide both teachers and administrators with professional development based on researched and tested best practices.

The key premise of the STEM STAR project is that students and educators must collaborate on a new, higher level if the goals of the i3 program reforms are to be met, sustained and brought to scale. STEM STAR?s student/teacher collaboration strategy is based on the Student Technology Leadership (STL) model developed by Generation Y and on a set of five strategies that include intensive professional development for STEM teachers, a Professional Learning Community, rural school emphasis, project-based inquiry, and student STEM leaders (SSLs).STEM STAR is an exceptional approach to lasting and transformative improvements in STEM teaching and learning because it will seek innovative solutions based on a student-educator collaboration model. Supported by moderate to strong prior educational research evidence, the STEM STAR model will distinguish itself from previous work by emphasizing STEM learning in rural middle schools and building on previous studies to strengthen the evidence that when students and teachers are given the opportunity to generate change and take ownership of that change, academic success follows.In each of 28 Washington state rural middle schools, a group of fifteen specially prepared SSLs will collaborate both face-to-face and online with STEM stakeholders (peers, teachers, scientists, researchers, content specialists, policy makers, and project administrators) to improve STEM achievement.

It comparison to national rates, the school dropout rate of Hispanic youth in the Cleveland Metropolitan School District (CMSD) is estimated to be an alarming 76% -- that is three times the national average.  Given the 'academic emergency' and 'academic watch' status of manyCMSD schools, a sweeping overhaul of the school system has inevitably arose.  As the only non-profit organization dedicated to the educational needs of Hispanic youth in CMSD, Esperanza, Inc., is in a strong position to work with its official partner (CMSD) toward improving the academic success of this high-need population, especially during the critical early elementary years.  The Prime Time for Reading program, which is one of many programs that Esperanza has provided to thousands of students, is naturallyaligned with the Academic Transformation Plan that is being implemented throughout CMSD.  For Hispanic children, this need is urgent, as Hispanic children have a 50% failure rate on state mandated reading tests.  Prime Time is a supplemental literacy program which can significantly help reduce the risk of academic failure for Hispanic youth with limited English proficiency, and in turn serve to help close the achievement gap.  The purpose of the project is twofold:  (a) to further develop and revise the model of quality programming that has been used in Prime Time through innovative practices that are shown to hold promise for improving the language proficiency of high-need LEP Hispanic students, and (b) to use a longitudinal, quasi-experimental design as a means of testing the effects of the newly revised program based on reasonable hypotheses derived from the positive outcomes gained from similar types of programs.

They operate a school that accepts all children as they are, builds upon their strengths and works to eliminate their weaknesses. Although the CRA student body includes ELL students (20%) and students with learning disabilities (20%), CRA students are academically advanced, happy, and excited to be in school. Their model of student-centered education is demonstrable, replicable and scalable. In 2009, CRA administered the Iowa Test of Basic Skills without preparation. The 3rd grade students ranked at the 93rd percentile, and the 5th grade students ranked at the 99th percentile of all benchmark public schools. This result demonstrates that active-learning is effective. A consortium of public school districts and CRA has been formed to operate the Student-Centered Education Model project to demonstrate and study the effects of a research-based, active-learning education model, compared to a parallel traditional education model. The project is expected to demonstrate replicable model schools that deliver very high graduation rates, produce highly prepared graduates who successfully complete universitystudies, and operate within existing public school budgets.  This project will allow public school districts to examine the results of an active-learning education model, collaboratively adjust curriculum, assessments, intervention plans, and professional development programs to improve their programs.CRA will be transformed into a model school to provide the Consortium open communications, Internet-based video monitoring, base-line definition configuration management, professional development, and project management services.

Starting in the 7th grade, students sign a commitment form to several scholastic, leadership and community service goals to be met before their high school graduation. Each year students will meet with appropriate WCS staff to go over yearly portfolio, academics and volunteer opportunities. There is a great need to serve our most underrepresented students in our community and we feel we can focus a lot of attention on our low income and minority populations. Also, we are looking to add a stronger college/career readiness aspect to the WCS program to better prepare our local students for the challenges down the road. To be recognized as a WCS, students must sign a commitment form, complete an annual portfolio, complete 10 hours of community service and graduate high school with an accumulative GPA of 3.0. Over the past couple years, over 100 students have been graduating our local high schools as World Class Scholars but that number could be significantly higher if the resources and manpower was available to do so and address the issues which face our neediest students.

Linked to the course-specific Virginia standards of learning (SOLs) and assessments, these real world simulations are intended to influence student self-efficacy as a mediating variable on student engagement, achievement, and subsequent selection of more advanced mathematics and science courses considered essential for pursuing careers in the green economy. The project will serve approximately 7,000 students.   	Academy teachers will integrate the 'green economy' PBL simulations and related assessments into their high school math and science courses. As a complement to the 'educate-to-innovate' strategy, teachers will complete a blended online graduate course, Principles of Innovation in Education. Students will produce promising entrepreneurial business ideas in a new web-based dual-enrollment course, Education, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship, with 100 tuition-free slots reserved. The course will link college and career readiness standards to innovation, entrepreneurship and development of local rural economies.

Every educator, and business person, is well aware of this challenge, and of how difficult it usually is. 'Where am I ever going to use this?' or 'Why do I need to learn this?' are questions that every instructor has heard and, while there are sometimes answers provided (though not often enough) sometimes the answer is 'Because there is a test on it next Friday.'

The PROJECT is intelligently designed to address a perennial education question concerning the link between the arts and differentiated teaching (to pupils displaying diverse learning styles). Since the evolution of homo sapiens, humans have created art; the arts are an essential part of our nature and all children respond to one art form or another. The PROJECT will further scientifically test the efficacy of a well-defined promising arts-integrated instructional methodology on the teaching and learning of English language arts skills by grades K - 2 pupils.The PROJECT uses drama, dance/creative movement, the visual arts, music, cooking, and games to promote growth in literacy skills of kindergarten through second grade pupils. Sample instructional activities include: making shapes of letters with their body while singing the sounds of the letter and dancing to reinforce letter recognition, creating phonic flap books to build decoding skills, miming to foster learning of new sight words, using puppets to tell stories, using drama presentations to teach character analysis, singing songs such as The Silent Letter 'E' to illustrate phonemic concepts, and other interactive strategies to teach the school's 'business as usual' (BAU) early childhood curriculum.""",AP3: High Standards and High-Quality Assessments,CP5: Early Learning,Nonprofit w/ consortium of schools,Development,4 years,4470458,No,"New York, NY

An integrated system based on Deming?s Plan-Do-Check-Act business management model and Effective Schools research form the foundational pieces of the 8-Step Process. Data drives instructional pacing calendars and teaching focus; principals and teacher teams use interim test results in monthly data meetings to monitor progress, identify student needs for remediation or enrichment and adjust instruction; and formal Process Checks monitor outcomes. Fully-employed in K-8, significantly increased achievement compels full implementation of the model at the high school level. Funding will enhance existing frameworks as K-12 instructional calendars and interim assessments are realigned to Common Core Standards, and middle school literacy coaches participate in data meetings and support literacy across non-English course content areas. Funds will target support for high-need high school students. Incoming freshmen at high-risk for dropping out will receive individual, group and parental support to address non-academic barriers to success. Learning time will be extended for underachieving and underrepresented HS students through after-school tutoring for students failing interim assessments; double-blocked English 10 and Algebra I classes for students at highest risk based on prior year data; and 10 additional school days for students failing State tests or English and algebra course work, and five more days for students in advanced placement or dual enrollment courses.

Unlike other applicants, we do not present an innovative ?project?. Instead, we present our organization as an innovation in creating and sustaining minority-led high quality charter schools serving low-income minority students.Partners is a social venture investment fund that invests in high-potential, early stage minority-led charter schools /networks that educate high-need students. Partners? approach to investing is similar to venture capitalists, who take talented entrepreneurs through a very competitive, rigorous process with a keen focus on short- and long-term outcomes. Like preceding social venture funds such as Venture Philanthropy Partners, NewSchools Venture Fund (NewSchools), and Charter School Growth Fund (CSGF)?the latter with whom Partners incubated, we invest in talented education leaders and their charter schools. The return on investment is not only financial, but also social and one that contributes to the creation and sustainability of outstanding charter schools that provide the high-quality public education that increases high-needs students? academic achievement, high school graduation rates, and college enrollment and graduation. The ultimate goal is to find the best minority leaders with the highest probability of efficiently starting and running a successful charter school or network that is sustainable primarily on public funds, and facilitate the creation and operation of that school so that it has demonstrable results for high-need students. By targeting an untapped population of school leaders who have gone missing and unnoticed in the charter school sector, Partners? directly addresses Investing in Innovation?s Absolute Priority #1: Innovations that Support Effective Teachers and Principals.""",AP1: Effective Teachers and Principals,,Nonprofit w/ consortium of schools,Development,3 years,3880476,No,"Los Angeles, CA

This is achieved by long-term (7th through 12th grades) intensive extracurricular mentoring. Our approach has been validated by the studies of the Johns Hopkins sociologist Karl Alexander which conclude that ,' virtually all of the advantage that bright wealthy students have over bright poor students is the result of differences in the way privileged children learn when they are not in school. Poor homes and communities do not have the resources, enrichment opportunities or activities  so that talented students can keep learning outside the formal classroom'.Our 15 year record strongly supports this conclusion and our remedy: Providing for our 7th through 12th grade 'scholars' what a middle class family would provide for their college-bound child. Please note that we accomplish this for a total cost per scholar over the six year program of $11,000 or an average of just $1830 per year /scholar.The volunteer mentor directs the program for his/her scholar and provides counseling, encouragement  and evaluation of the scholar's development as he/she progresses through the program.In addition to the individual mentors we have a volunteer College Coordinator at each venue to optimize the college admission process.

MC2 will feature an online portal that coordinates design, implementation and assessment of high quality learning opportunities. Students will be able to develop a personal learning plan, identify ELO options, match state and national standards, request a teacher-coach with expertise in the ELO competencies, and document learning through a variety of formative assessment tools and performance-based assessments. The online portal will be designed to be user friendly, paying particular attention to graphics, readability, and language, with a dynamic and engaging interface.A key strategy of MC2 is to provide ongoing support, monitoring, and feedback for all parties. Teachers and community partners in both LEAs will receive training and ongoing professional support. An accountability plan will be collaboratively developed; performance indicators will be established and monitored for students, teachers, community partners, and MC2 Coordinators; and metrics and data systems will be implemented from the outsetThe primary premise of the MC2 system is a shift from the ?batch and queue? model of public schooling to ?continuous flow?, where learners progress and graduate based on mastery of competencies, rather than time. This provides essential flexibility for systematically responding to specific needs of all learners. A second key premise is that implementing high standards and high quality assessments requires students to engage directly with understanding the content and skills needed to meet those standards and to co-design work that enlists them in mastering academically rigorous and relevant content and skills.""",AP3: High Standards and High-Quality Assessments,"CP7: Unique Learning Needs, CP8: Rural LEAs",Nonprofit w/ consortium of schools,Development,5 years,5000000,No,"Concord, NH

PFL will: 1) Enroll a critical mass of middle-school students, 10-15% of all fifth grade students, from four low-performing schools (405 students total) in three partnering school districts: Chester Upland School District, School District of Lancaster, and Milwaukee Public Schools (WI) to demonstrate that enrichment, in a small cohort, can serve to raise the performance of all students within the grade. This will be undertaken through PFL?s proven, academically rigorous residential summer institutes on college campuses and a high school college preparation and coaching initiative. Seventy percent of the fully enrolled population will participate in an advanced or high-level, core subjects program. Gains of 5-10% are anticipated for the remainder of the cohort.  And 2) Conduct, with grant support, Summer Teacher Academies, backed by two weekend school-year retreats, for a cohort of math teachers from eleven low-performing middle schools (44 teachers) and three high schools (36 teachers).  Through the Summer Academies and school year workshops the teachers will advance their pedagogical practices and improve high-need student preparedness for advanced level courses in high school.

The University of Virginia-School Turnaround Specialist Program (UVA-STSP) is a two-year district and school leader development program that includes executive education, strategic support, resources, and tools for school and district teams charged with embarking upon bold turnaround initiatives in an effort to rescue schools from failure. Although our work to date with 121 schools in 9 states has yielded promising results, further program development and refinement and more formal, systematic study is warranted. Based on the research literature and our experience, we propose that deploying highly effective leaders and building district capacity by codifying the systemic conditions and capabilities to support highly-capable leaders has potential to optimize the success of turnaround efforts. We propose that we can improve school turnaround outcomes by developing a more intentional effort to build district capacity to support turnaround and in particular to implement rigorous, competency-based leader recruitment, selection, and development procedures. In partnership with the Darden School Foundation, Cincinnati Public Schools and the Texas Education Service Center 13, we are applying for a $4.2 million dollar, three-year i3 grant to develop a novel approach to school turnaround that incorporates an intense focus on district capacity and selection of highly-skilled turnaround leaders.

Curriculum and instructional practices will focus on the learning needs of students who have dropped out or who are in danger of dropping out of  school.  We intend to focus on a long-term approach that will: o	enhance the holding power of schools, with an intensive focus on ninth grade o    focus on the forces outside of school that contribute to dropping out o    address the needs of those groups at highest risk of dropping out o	build on the skills and understanding of the adults who affect teens' motivation and ability to stay in school Building Hope will make available interest free loans of up to $600,000 to local nonprofit entities that successfully receive a charter for the renovation and repair of the building that has been selected as a school site. The payback will commence when the school reaches enrollment 400 students. There is enough cash flow between the anticipated student enrollments of 400 to 500 students to pay back the loan over a 3 year period. Each school will be able to make payments of approximately $17,000 monthly, for a yearly total of $200,000. These funds will enable Building Hope (who will be custodians of the account,) to make loans in perpetuity.  Thus, schools could be replicated (using the original i3 grant monies), throughout America. This would be based solely on the market need for 350-500 drop- out students in a community.

We will implement a data warehouse with a user-friendly, customizable dashboard  that will dramatically improve timely and accurate access to data, not to mention the number of people who use the data, and the amount of time they will gain to use what they've learned from the data.  We believe that data warehouse abilities will help RCPS (and other districts) make better, faster, more efficient instructional decisions using custom reports designed specifically to deliver the information that is relevant. A comprehensive data consolidation mechanism will improve relevancy and accuracy of search results and increase access points so users find information quickly and easily. Next, this system will enable more meaningful and useful reporting, providing specific drill-down accuracy and information consolidation for all levels of users. Additionally, it will streamline searching and information retrieval, increasing the number of times information is accessed. These reports will lead to instructional and operational changes that increase student achievement and meet the complex reporting needs at district, state and federal levels.

Through the Inquiry-based Science Laboratory Activities (ISLA) Project, in-service science teachers will develop laboratory curricula with incremental inquiry content aligned with the Rhode Island (RI) K-12 Grade Span (GSE) and Grade Level Expectations (GLE) in the Sciences. The ISLA Project will commence with the implementation of the Guided Inquiry Based Interdisciplinary Science (GIBIS) Center in a dedicated space at Salve Regina University. During the first three years of the Project, teachers working in teams will develop a curriculum consisting of 12 activities in Chemistry, Physics, or Biology/Environmental Science at three different inquiry levels, with four labs developed and classroom-tested each year. A two-step assessment with an associated rubric will be developed by each team. Using the GIBIS Center, the Salve Regina Department of Education will implement workshops for pre-service science teachers to train them to develop and use inquiry based materials and the necessary technology. During years four and five the GIBIS Center will be made available for teacher quality improvement programs for teachers from other school districts within RI.The ISLA project has received the enthusiastic support of the three partner school districts. As a result, we expect 18 teachers to participate in the project. This will provide the project with teams of experienced and dedicated teachers for the curricula development effort. Students at all high school grade levels in all three districts will be affected by this project.""",AP3: High Standards and High-Quality Assessments,CP7: Unique Learning Needs,Nonprofit w/ LEA,Development,5 years,769548,No,"Newport, RI

Although Ninth grade has grown to be known as 'The Dropout Year' for many American schools, this dreadful title is supported by research indicating that Ninth grade serves as a bottleneck for freshmen students lacking the sufficient academic skills to merge into high school level work (Balfanz and Legters 2006). This suggests there is a rift in the vertical alignment of elementary to secondary transitioning and that students are entering high school unprepared from years prior to 9th grade, not in 9th grade. The program proposed by SBCISD impacts students from 5th grade through their 9th grade years. The i3 Spark Project is to provide San Benito CISD elementary schools with funding necessary to immerse their upcoming 5th Grade student population with on-demand technology access at school and at home.

The use of predictive analytics in education that is described in the following project narrative uniquely positions San Jose Unified School District to address the learning needs of students with disabilities and English Learners. Data identifying these subgroups are routinely available in most district systems. However, the complexity and accuracy of data collection, synthesis, and analysis prove challenging. Comprehensive analyses are often limited by lack of data quality and availability, and additional sources of information about the quality of programs serving these students are rarely collected systematically. Using the District's data warehouse to support the predictive analytics proposed in this project will increase SJUSD's understanding of the complex needs of these diverse learners. Predictive analytics will help us discover unknown relationships, confirm known or suspected relationships and leverage those relationships for better decision making and student support. Such analytics, for example, could help discern which environments and curricula better optimize language acquisition and content mastery for ELs or how to match interventions to the individualized needs of special education students at various levels of intensity. Beyond quantifying EL and disabled student performance, we will be able to identify potentially causal relationships between students' characteristics, their experiences in the academic and social environments of schools and their successful completion of rigorous courses of study.

The project replicates a strategy designed by Dr. Thomas Maridada, Superintendent of Pontiac School District, and piloted with tremendous success at a small, extremely low-performing school district in a neighboring metropolitan Detroit community (Inkster Public Schools, Inkster, Michigan). The fundamental design of PEACE applies Backward Design strategies (Wiggins and McTighe, 2001) to build a project that promotes attainment of positive and rigorous student postsecondary education outcomes. The strategy links all grade levels through the singular purpose of preparing high-risk, urban, minority students to overcome persistent cycles of academic failure, graduate from high school and enroll in and succeed in postsecondary education. While implementation of PEACE may generate numerous desirable student outcomes, all efforts are clearly linked to postsecondary education enrollment. The core component of the project ? College Pathways ? can serve as a stand-alone implementation model. To best meet the specific needs of Pontiac students and schools, PEACE includes supplementary layers of support that promote success of the core approach to college enrollment ? school preparation and student preparation.

Southern Methodist University,e-Learning Universe: Integrating Middle School Literacy and Science Instruction Infused with the Arts,Dallas,TX,75205,"""Recent attention in education has focused on enhancing the quality of science instruction in our nation?s schools. What has not received as much attention is the reality that low achievement in science is often linked to low performance in literacy. Problems of low literacy and science performance are especially apparent in schools that serve primarily students from low-income families.  Since literacy proficiency in our information driven society largely determines a child?s academic, social, occupational, and health trajectory for the rest of his or her life, it is critical that low literacy be addressed.  Likewise, with increased emphasis on science in the career sector, poor scientific performance reduces a student?s career choices. To address both low science and literacy skills, we propose to build an integrated 8th grade curriculum built within the e-Learning Universe., that links literacy instruction and science instruction using themes derived from 8th grade integrated physical science.

The project, i3: Effective Teachers, Leaders, and Tools, combines 21st century tools of TetraData? and Fast ForWord? with the Teacher Advancement Program (TAP) model for building teacher and leader effectiveness providing a comprehensive plan to increase student achievement and close achievement gaps. The project partners the Follett Software Company, Scientific Learning Corporation, Louisiana Department of Education, and the National Institute of Excellence in Teaching with the St. Mary Parish School Board. The development grant utilizes the Teacher Advancement Program (TAP) to increase teacher and leader capacity through high quality professional development. Collegial coaching, a component of the TAP model has been shown to be of the most effective means to improve practice that leads to student learning. Teachers and leaders follow a TAP rubric and receive performance-based pay for student learning.  Teachers are equipped with 21st century tools for data analyzation (TetraData?) and student intervention (Fast ForWord?), both of which have demonstrated usefulness in increasing academic achievement for students in the district. Project evaluation includes monitoring for fidelity of TetraData?, and Fast ForWord? use as well as TAP implementation. Annual evaluation seeks to report the increase in teacher effectiveness as evidenced by observations of teacher practice, by increases in teacher perceptions of the effectiveness of PD they receive, and by the increase in student achievement and narrowing of achievement gaps for the two-thousand, one-hundred, fifty-five students in the project.  Combining the TAP model with proven 21st century tools presents an innovative project to ensuring student achievement growth in the rural public school district.""",AP1: Effective Teachers and Principals,"CP7: Unique Learning Needs, CP8: Rural LEAs",LEA,Development,5 years,4999995,Yes,"Centerville, LA

St. Mary's County Public Schools,College Access for Everyone,Leonardtown,MD,20650,"""Stereotype Theat has been identified by researchers as a likely explanation why minority students performance often falls behind majority students' performance. Stereotype Threat occurs when students who belong to a group feel as though they may perform poorly, thus confirming the stereotype about their group. It is theorized that the fear of confiming the stereotype causes the students to perform at a lower level. This project will combat stereotype threat by holding weekly sessions at lunchtime to remind students of their strengths and abilities. The lunchtime sessions will focus on getting Junior and Senior high school students ready for college, teaching them the skills they need, when they need them. By continuously helping students plan for college, they are receiving affirmations, which have been shown by researchers, even when only provided once per semester, to dramatically increase student performance. There are thousands of  college access programs across the U.S., however, this new design should vastly increase the success of the programs. This program has a two year curriculum that will serve Juniors and Seniors. We have searched, but not found anything similar. This program teaches students the skills they need at the exact time when they need them. They learn about and practice college interviews just before they have interviews, for example. Other programs may be drop-in, may be off-site, or may pull students out of other classes. CAFE will also work with Freshmen and Sophomore in their English classes with a focus on teaching them about the benefits of a college education and convincing them that it is important for them to take the most challenging classes possible. Partners will work with the program to remove the barriers that keep students from pursuing a college degree.

They and their parentswill also show a deeper understanding of and commitment to the intellectual skills needed for college andcareers.TC and its partners, The Workplace Center at Columbia University School of Social Work, AbyssinianDevelopment Corporation, and a consortium of four public schools in New York City, will collaborate inreaching up to 450 middle grade students and their parents per year, with a cumulative impact on 1,750students.""",AP3: High Standards and High-Quality Assessments,CP6: College Access and Success College Access and Success,Nonprofit w/ consortium of schools,Development,5 years,3605097,No,"New York, NY

"Teachers College, Columbia University",Academic and Health Efforts for Achievement and development (AHEAD),New York,NY,10027,"""Over the past 5 decades school reforms, including intensified, lengthened, or improved instruction, teacher training, supervision and coaching, charter schools and accountability tied to standardized test scores, have been implemented in an attempt to close the achievement gap. The achievement gap, however, persists, disproportionately threatening the quality of life and social mobility of urban minority youth. The effectiveness of previous reforms has been undermined, in part, by parallel, largely unaddressed disparities in educationally relevant health factors. These health factors disproportionately affect urban minority youth and strongly affect both motivation and ability to learn. We propose to compare the effects of evidence-based academic interventions when implemented alone and when complemented by a strategic set of evidence-based health innovations in 8 persistently low performing schools in New York City. Priority health factors have high prevalence, strong effects on educational outcomes, and feasibility for being addressed in schools: poor vision; asthma; ADHD; aggression and violence; physical inactivity; skipping breakfast. More than 300 current peer-reviewed empirical studies unequivocally demonstrate how these health factors impede motivation and ability to learn. These health factors affect millions of urban minority youth, have powerful effects on student achievement, and are amenable to change; yet there is no U.S. Department of Education initiative that targets them as part of a strategy to close the achievement gap. While most schools currently address some health problems, efforts are too often of poor quality, and are neither strategically planned noreffectively coordinated to influence educational outcomes. Specific evidence based school health programs exist that can, indeed must, be implemented in a coordinated and strategic fashion if we are to have any hope of closing the achievement gap. The approach has never been tried.""",AP4: Persistently Low-Performing Schools,"CP5: Early Learning, CP7: Unique Learning Needs",Nonprofit w/ consortium of schools,Validation,5 years,25634849,No,"New York, NY

This initiative will help 6,900 children in 20 randomly chosen NYC Title I elementary schools by transferring, extending and adapting methods fundamental to ELA classrooms into social studies classrooms. To accomplish this, the schools will be supported with summer institutes and on-site professional development and with classroom libraries of leveled books aligned to a social studies curriculum teachers will co-construct with project staff. Teachers will become part of the community of practice that works to develop hypothetical learning progressions that describe how children develop skills in content area literacy and concepts that are essential to social studies. As this community of practice tracks and supports students' progress, a map of academic literacy and concept development will be constructed, revised, and put to use, allowing teachers to design more appropriate instruction, monitor student progress, and give students more personalized feedback, and allowing the entire effort to learn effective ways of supporting academic literacy.   Brian Rowan will analyze the relationship between program implementation and students' achievement on the NY Social Studies and English Language Arts tests using a quasi-experimental design.  His feedback will enable the work to be revised until it is successful, producing effect sizes of d = 0.70 or higher for high implementation teachers.

All 43 boys from the pilot program in grades 2-4 have progressed in school for 3 years, while receiving supports founded upon evidence-based practices and designed by a group of national experts and community stakeholders.  Full-time Life Coaches orchestrate resources and coordinate nested relationships between home, school and community for the boys, helping them become inspired by special interests and overcome set-backs; a team of tutors provides individualized academic support; a Saturday Cultural Academy instills pride and a sense of positive group identity; volunteer Everyday Heroes expose the boys to the array of great careers that men of color assume.  For this reason, The Children's Aid Society (CAS) requests a Development grant to address Absolute Priority 4: Innovations that Turn Around Persistently Low-Performing Schools. The program will also address competitive priority 5 - Innovations for Improving Early Learning Outcomes, and competitive priority 6 - Innovations that Support College Access. The data presented from a pilot implementation of STS demonstrate promising results from this early intervention in shifting family, teacher, and youth expectations and planning for college attendance, which is important in advance of the middle school transition before students get to high school. The major partners in this endeavor are The Children's Aid Society; Frederick Douglass Academy, a public school and host of our Saturday Cultural Academy; four low performing schools in Harlem's District 5; and, an independent evaluation team from the Columbia University School of Social Work.""",AP4: Persistently Low-Performing Schools,"CP5: Early Learning, CP6: College Access and Success College Access and Success",Nonprofit w/ consortium of schools,Development,5 years,3851339,No,"New York, NY

Surpassing even the most rigorous studies which control for two or three variables, this spectacular application controls for every factor for which a state tracks data.  The result is that grant providers, principals, researchers, and teachers can reliably compare growth between and among all schools within a state.  A second result is a completely bias-free listing of highest to lowest schools based on the most level playing field imaginable.  The logical outcome is that for the first time ever, we can identify where best practices may be found.  That is, after the affect of factors over which principals have little to no control are eliminated from pass-rates, what remains is the impact of best practices.  	In the second step or phase, we visit the now accurately- identified schools, contrasting the constellation of materials and adult behaviors in the highest and lowest performing schools. 	In the third and final step, we replicate in rural Kentucky and Virginia two integrated best practices, one related to school readiness and the other to third-grade reading levels, creating more robust evidence of these kinds of best practices.

Making the Grade will improve academic outcomes and graduation rates among economically disadvantaged students considered most at risk of failure in sixteen Title I high schools across Pennsylvania. At risk students are placed in alternative education programs because of academic, behavioral, social, or emotional problems.  Although segregating these students from traditional classrooms often is necessary, doing so poses a challenge to repatriation and graduation.  Alternative education students who remain on campus must continue to receive instruction in their core subjects, however alternative education instruction is developed by an external provider to suit a range of student ages and abilities and is not synchronized with the lessons being taught in their own classes.  Those students sent off campus can receive instruction from external providers that vary widely in quality.To lower these barriers, The Consortium, in collaboration with VLN Partners, Inc., a Pittsburgh-based developer of online education programs, will implement Making the Grade and the holistic model for blended learning to help our network of Title I high schools and their more than 400 students.  The holistic model for blended learning brings together customized lessons that are synchronized with traditional classroom instruction, taught by professional teachers, and actively engage students to create alternative education programs that really help at risk students.   With Making the Grade, each partner school will receive all of the tools necessary to establish an alternative education program that will break the cycle of repatriation, remediation and return to alternative education.

Within the existing model, high school seniors and teacher advisors have mentored the high school freshman to provide additional assistance during their transition. The proposed activities would build upon that model by utilizing the Child and Adolescent Wellness Scale (CAWS) for building overall well-being and the Educational Planning and Assessment System (EPAS) ACT series for building academic assets. These assessments will guide the development of the curricular activities within the one period course based upon student characteristics and needs. Further, we will receive mentor training and additional mentors from ourpartner, Applied Principles for Service, Inc as well as CSUSB School Counseling and School Psychology graduate students. Consequently, through a well structured mentoring program guided by a focus on overall wellness and by reducing the ratio of ?mentor? per student and parent(s), this proposed intervention would focus on meeting both the wellness and achievement needs of the approximately 700 ninth grade adolescents participating in the intervention at Chino High School.

In order to effectively deliver services to children who need assistance to succeed at school, it must come through one person with whom they have a positive relationship. The solution is to provide academic advocates for individual students who form a positive helping relationship with the child and their family, help s/he access resources and services and follow up after. The advocate checks on the child and helps them in the classroom and facilitates communication between school, student, caregivers, after school and other services the youth uses (i.e. speech therapy). The benefits: Schools have improved grades and behavior. Teachers have help assisting a child who needs extra help and has issues outside of school distracting him/her. A child gets support through an adult who understands their whole life, not just school issues. Parents get parenting cheerleaders, advice, an example in advocating for their child and the opportunity to see their child succeed. Academic Advocacy is an easily replicable program that is an outstanding innovation in education, parenting engagement and social service delivery. Summary of project objectives and expected outcomes: Children will improve one letter grade in their report cards in 50% of their subjects and will self-report feeling more supported at school.

The model is used by 98 school districts and has achieved positive results. HITOP will be designed to help turn around persistently low-performing schools with a targeted approach to reform by: 1) increasing instructional time for core academic subjects with one-on-one, multi-session per week tutoring, and 2) integrating student tutoring supports in the existing school model to address non-academic barriers to student achievement such as non-attendance and number of discipline referrals. OASIS and its official LEA partners will recruit, train and support 3,551 older adult tutor assignments assisting 7,102 academically high-need students 2-3 times per week. As a result, the students? reading will improve through increased comprehension, and an evidence base and model will be in place to take to schools nationwide. HITOP will use a landmark research study by Washington University in St. Louis of the Experience Corps tutoring program for the reasonable hypotheses that student achievement in the primary grades is positively impacted by a high-dosage relationship with tutor that utilizes a language-focused curriculum that is consistent across schools, districts, and states.

The proposal is to the Development Program of the I3 program, and addresses absolute priority?Innovations that support Teachers and Principals,? and competitive priority ?Innovation that serve schools inRural LEA's.? We propose to develop and assess a system that will significantly improve the contentknowledge and pedagogical knowledge of teachers in schools, from rural to urban settings, with pairs of mathand science teachers from each school in the development phase. Approximately 30 teachers and 3600students will be served in this development effort. We hypothesize that this improvement will significantlyincrease student achievements, in 8th grade science and math. The target students/teachers are a sample inmostly Title 1 schools of rural and urban Arizona, Mississippi and Texas, and in suburban schools in the SanFrancisco Bay Area.Teachers of math or science in the middle schools often lack majors in either of these subjects. and tend todepend almost exclusively on the adopted textbook. . The math textbooks rarely demonstrate that math isinteresting, useful and applied to solving problems of science. The science textbooks in the middle schoolsusually avoid mathematics and therefore avoid involving students in important steps of solving problems ofscience.

In 2005 the Iowa Department of Education selected the Project Lead The Way (PLTW) curriculum to create a seamless transition for students from secondary school into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Initial studies we have carried out on the students taking PLTW courses indicate a significant increase in ITED math scores compared to non-participants with similar demographic data. In addition, 71% of PLTW transition to higher education vs. 50% of non-PLTW students. The primary objective of the proposed program is to expand our initial studies to a more complete assessment of the impact of the PLTW curriculum on student performance and attitudes. In addition, in the schools taking PLTW has been largely in larger urban schools. While 145/360 school districts in Iowa are small rural schools, only two small rural schools are participating in PLTW. Secondary goals of this project are to provide effective, sustainable models that allow expansion of the PLTW program into small rural school districts, and to improve the college readiness of Iowa students. Funding will support 85 new sites involving more than 100 LEAs. We will introduce the PLTW Gateway to Technology curriculum in the middle schools of 50 school districts.

Training for teachers includes: (1) intensive summer institutes, (2) weekly webcam coaching sessions and (3) specialized two-hour workshops twice each semester. An outside evaluation will collect teacher and student data to assess whether the intervention produces highly effective teachers and sustained student reading growth through 4th grade.
Project Objectives and Expected Outcomes include increasing the effectiveness of K-3 classroom teachers in low-wealth rural school districts by providing intensive professional development via webcam technology. It is expected that teachers with the intervention will improve their knowledge of literacy practices and improve their instruction compared to teachers in control schools. Both struggling and non-struggling readers will demonstrate dramatic growth in literacy and sustained growth through 4th grade in comparison to students in control schools.
Target Number of Students Served will include children over 4 years in 22 schools and 248 classrooms. Over 5,000 children should benefit from the intervention during the grant.
A special feature of this program is the use of highly cost effective live webcam literacy coaching to classroom teachers via laptop computers in remote rural schools.",AP1: Effective Teachers and Principals,"CP5: Early Learning, CP8: Rural LEAs",Nonprofit w/ LEA,Validation,5 years,19430101,No,"Chapel Hill, NC

Today's Students Tomorrow's Teachers,Full Circle Teacher Preparation Model,Elmsford,NY,10523,"""Today's Students Tomorrow's Teachers (TSTT) and its school partners are seeking a Validation grant to expand TSTT's Full Circle Teacher Preparation model. TSTT's Full Circle Teacher Preparation model is exceptional in that it supports high need students academically, financially and socially at every point along the teacher preparation pathway. Thus, it ensures that students graduate from high school, enter college with scholarships, graduate from college, and return 'Full Circle' to their communities as highly qualified teachers. While other teacher preparation programs operate in silos or just stop at key benchmarks -- leaving youth to navigate their own transition to the next step -- TSTT offers on-going mentoring, tutoring, instruction in educational practices, scholarships, career counseling, personal development, community-building, service opportunities, summer bridge programs and other supports over eight years of secondary and post-secondary education.  The TSTT program has five goals, all aligned with moving minority youth along the pathway toward becoming teachers:(1)	To improve student academic achievement. (2)	To increase the rate of high school graduation among program participants. (3)	To increase the rate of college enrollment (during the grant period) and graduation (after the grant period). (4)	To increase the number of minority youth participants staying on track to enter the teaching profession. (5)	To support effective teachers who can improve student achievement in high need schools. By the fifth year in this grant, TSTT and its partners expect to be serving 2,700 students in four states, and to be poised for further expansion. Based on TSTT's success in the past 15 years, this program is expected to raise student grades by 1 to 1.5 grade points and to result in a 90% high school graduation rate for participants.""",AP1: Effective Teachers and Principals,CP6: College Access and Success College Access and Success,Nonprofit w/ LEA,Validation,5 years,17233603,No,"Elmsford, NY

Designed by the Mosaica Leadership Institute, TLI's programs are both research-based and school-proven.  The program is built on the PD and mentoring programs that led to the successful turnarounds of the four charter schools/LEA's participating in this application (see Official Partners, below).  TLI brings together best practices in student-centered curriculum delivery and business-enterprise turnaround leadership techniques that have been proven effective.  Unlike other leadership programs, TLI offers principals the opportunity for extensive and focused professional development in a time frame suited to the rapid pace of school turnaround initiatives.  The TLI program is individualized to meet the needs of each principal, with coursework differentiated by their schools' grade levels, job-embedded learning, and ongoing hands-on training, as well as  mentoring of each principal by school turnaround experts over the three-year term of the grant.  Objectives:  To provide new school turnaround principals with: 1) Instruction in 'best practices' for turnaround management, 2) Support/mentoring from experienced turnaround leaders, 3) Effective turnaround tools that have been shown to produce results in both school- and business-turnaround environments, and 4) A network of supportive colleagues with whom they can share experiences and obtain advice and support.    Outcomes:  The Turnaround Leadership Institute will increase the number of principals well-equipped to improve the performance of high-needs schools by 1) Engaging in effective instructional leadership practices, 2) Using data to effectively instruct, evaluate, and develop teachers, and 3) Inspiring cultural change to develop highly effective school communities.

These programs have re-created the high school experience for hundreds of students, engaging their passions during and BEYOND the school day and increasing post-secondary and career readiness. While 25% of our current high school students are enrolled in these programs, we must engage more students, especially under-represented students.  For example, while district diversity is growing, diversity enrollment in the 21st CHS programs is nearly negligible. This proposal maps a pathway for more students from all demographic groups to participate. Four barriers exclude under-represented students: 1) poor literacy skills impacting all content areas, 2) lack of experience with post-secondary possibilities and career options, especially in the areas of science, technology, engineering, and math, 3) lack of adult advisors and mentors; and 4) the lack of 21st CHS programs aligned with student interest and the community's economic drivers. To increase enrollment, interventions begin at elementary, continuing through middle and high school. Curriculum will be re-aligned with the Core and Career/Technical Education Standards, comprehensive literacy strategies taught, home and college visits conducted for students and families, adult advisors and mentors provided, and 21st CHS program options increased to match student and job market needs. Data will enhance decision-making, with a focus on increased formative assessment measures.

Theapproach of this trial program contrasted starkly with large ?top down? PK-12 STEM education reformmodels. It arose from the AMSP?s effort to establish working partnerships across all grade levels and wasbased on the recognition that smaller ?micro-investments? might be an effective means of empoweringpartners in the PK-12 schools districts to initiate partnerships with higher education (IHE) faculty. The firstconcern is that due to significant differences in the degree of development and support of mathematics andscience education reform in the districts, a primary feature of the PEP concept is the recognition that thedistrict is best suited to address specific STEM needs in the district. A second and related element is that theseneeds might be identified more effectively by the teachers and administrators at the local school and districtlevel than by generic national studies or the literature on mathematics and science education reform. The thirdelement is that in order for the partnership to be viable, the school and the IHE partner(s) must contribute bothmeaningfully and effectively to the design, implementation and evaluation of the mathematics and/or sciencereform activity. The latter characteristic of this trial program was viewed by AMSP?s external evaluators asproviding ?empowerment? in the form of a voice and role for the PK-12 teacher partner(s) that was oftenlacking in the U.S. primary, middle and secondary school system.

University of Washington,Increasing College Readiness: Research on Project-Based Learning Approaches to Advanced Placement (AP) Courses,Seattle,WA,98195,"""For over 50 years, Advanced Placement courses have been a national benchmark for rigorous high school curricula. Today, education reformers look upon AP as one piece of the puzzle for developing a ?Common Core? system of high-quality standards and assessments across states (National Governors Association, 2009). Many urban and suburban school districts alike are encouraging and even requiring students to take one or more advanced courses in the name of ?equity? and ?access? to college pathways and life success. Yet many worry that AP is too memorization focused and lags behind modern research on how people learn (2002). Initial work by our group shows that, with appropriate innovation a much broader array of students can take challenging courses and find fertile grounds to succeed. To build on these findings, we seek additionalfunding over four years from the Investing in Innovation (i3) Fund.We will further develop and assess the effectiveness of rigorous PBL approaches to AP courses, with particular emphasis on working with students in schools with large percentages of low-income students. Specifically, we will investigate across three different school system settings (urban, suburban, urban public charter) whether our project-based learning approaches to AP can yield (1) same or better pass rates on the AP Exam, (2) same or better pass rates on a test of applied reasoning in the subject (Complex Scenario Test), and (3) higher student engagement in the courses. Working with Rockman Evaluators, we seek to show both what works and why it works, and how to help others adapt the work to their particular settings.

The high school is in its seventh year of not making Adequate Yearly Progress.  The hypothesis is that the RTI process will accelerate achievement in reading and math among high-need 9th graders as it has in the district's 11 elementary and 2 middle schools.  In the 9th grade, 52% are low income, 5% ELL, 45% minority and 18% special education.  Over the past five years, double-digit gains in math and reading proficiency among 2,700 district middle school students, along with promising results in the literature, suggest the efficacy of the RTI framework.  Upper Darby is applying for a development grant under Priority 2 - Improved Use of Data Systems (a) because, in the district's experience, data-based decision making was the single most important RTI component contributing to student gains.  The district has developed RTI protocols, fidelity checklists and standard operating procedures, and will adopt them in the Academy utilizing professional development.  The evaluation will measure outcomes in five goal areas: 1) increased proficiency in reading and mathematics among 3,000 freshmen over three years including 450 special education students and 150 English language learners, 2) incorporation of six RTI components in the Academy infrastructure, 3) faculty implementation of RTI practices with fidelity, 4) increased parental understanding of their child's learning strengths and needs through the lens of RTI, and 5) dissemination of project results and products to educators, researchers and educational systems.  Partners include Indiana University of Pennsylvania, the Pennsylvania Training and Technical Assistance Network, the Delaware County Intermediate Unit, and the Upper Darby Arts and Education Foundation.

The program's goal is to provide a solution to the problem of providing an adequate vocabulary for high need students from lower SES families, the lack of which initiates the 4th grade 'slump' growing worse each year and leading many students to drop out despite receiving an excellent early reading instruction and learning to decode. Scholars have shown that high need students from limited vocabulary families know only 4,000 root words entering the 3rd and 4th grade when the books they will be reading require 6,000. Waterford has developed a program that will enable the students to learn an additional 500 words a year for 4 years to arrive at the 4th grade having made up the 2,000 words. This program could reduce the pressure and expense on schools and teachers and provide summer instruction to try to make up the vocabulary shortfall. Until this problem is solved, high need students will continue to drop out in droves. The programs utilize the most successful model of vocabulary instruction that scholars prototyped but have been unable to scale because of the unusual demands of having to teach 25-50 new words a week.

The software will be used to improve early reading development by teaching pre-literacy and early literacy skills to beginning readers in kindergarten and first and second grades.   The purpose of the three-year project is to determine the correlation between time using WERP and reading skill gained when prescribed usage standards are met.  WERP is computer-adaptive software, and its theoretical framework and results from a  battery of empirical testing show it to represent an immediate and sizable opportunity for effecting change in the classroom.  But, after nearly two decades of work with traditional public schools, it is apparent that teachers often face challenges finding time in their day for students to use educational technology frequently enough and long enough to reap the software's benefits.  Waterford's partnership with charter schools is key because charter schools offer teachers more authority to make classroom decisions than most traditional public schools.  In addition to their flexibility to manage their time, charter schools frequently make more time for learning by lengthening the teaching day with morning and afternoon programs added to the regular school-day schedule and by doubling up instruction in core subjects.   The partnership will add to the understanding of and appreciation for the validity of using software in early education as a tool for helping children reach their learning potential.

Started in 1988, the Arkansas ACE program is a 30-day residential, educational and wilderness experience for 165 at-risk third, fourth, and fifth-graders. With an emphasis in reading comprehension and math, certified teachers will implement a similar experiential learning program on an isolated wooded peninsula surrounded by wilderness lakes in Northern Indiana. Start-up funding for Webster Foundation's ACE program would be for five years and - at capacity -- serve 200 to 300 children per year.	        In Little Rock, the ACE program is a cooperative venture with the Little Rock School District and the Pulaski County Special School District. Duplicating this extensive field trial, the Webster Foundation proposes a similar cooperative partnership with local education agencies (LEAs) in northern Indiana. For participation in the program, area school teachers, counselors or principals select students from the third, fourth and fifth grades who are considered at-risk for failure socially and educationally. Not working up to their potential, these at-risk students are defined as: poor academic performance in class; poor economic status at home; single parent home; parent in prison; exposed to violence; sexually or emotionally abused; or low self esteem.	        ACE students arrive on Sunday afternoon and stay until Friday afternoon for five weeks. During this time they are housed in cabins with 8-10 other students and two adult counselors. This group becomes like a family. Classes are held in camp classrooms where two certified teachers and several counselors test, teach, guide, discipline, and support these students in learning.

Weymouth Public Schools,"Design21 - Developing 21st Century Skills in Weymouth, Massachusetts",Weymouth,MA,2189,"""The Weymouth Public School Department (WPS) is pleased to submit this proposal as a Development Project for funding under the Investing in Innovation competitive grant program (i3).  Design 21 - Developing 21st Century Skills (D21) represents a focused, innovative, instructional approach to preparing students for high school graduation and their future success. Our vision is a redesigned model of school where the focus will be on the development of core 21st century process skills, expressed through the creation of written and oral products.  Our hypothesis is:  Students who participate in high-quality, on-going learning experiences designed around defined 21st century process skills will achieve measurable success in school by graduating high school prepared to succeed in postsecondary endeavors. Our project builds on the current WHS21 model at Weymouth High School, a model we believe has the potential for efficacy when replicated in additional settings.  Our challenge is to replicate and expand the model to existing schools K-12 in Weymouth and Southeastern Massachusetts. The D21 model will be introduced across all schools in Weymouth during the first year, with a focus on communication and education at all sites.  Project implementation will continue at the district middle schools (two) during years 2 and 3; and at district primary schools (eight) during years 3 and 4.  The fifth and final project year will be devoted to dissemination outside the district, creating a Coalition for P21 schools on the South Shore in Massachusetts. At the conclusion of the five-year project, we will have developed a fully scalable model for implementation across district lines.""",AP3: High Standards and High-Quality Assessments,"CP5: Early Learning, CP6: College Access and Success College Access and Success, CP7: Unique Learning Needs, CP8: Rural LEAs",LEA,Development,5 years,4998139,No,"Weymouth, MA

WST piloted Books Alive (BAP) through Head Start with over a dozen Detroit area schools and libraries in 2001-2002, and is seeking to develop the program locally with underperforming schools where achievement gap issues have been persistent. BAP is designed to inspire a lifelong love of reading and writing. Drama workshops for children enable them to bring 'books alive' and learn about the basic components of a story. This kinesthetic and abstract learning is reinforced with classroom activities and live performances by Wild Swan artists. BAP also trains teachers how to use drama as an ongoing part of their curriculum. Independent evaluation  (see Appendix H) has shown the early model of the Books Alive program to be highly effective in introducing and reinforcing literacy skills. The new program will be residency-based in three core schools in Ann Arbor where WST will train teachers, perform stories, and lead workshops where children will create their own dramatic works.  Through the BAP, youth will improve skills in literacy, story creation, cause-effect awareness, creativity and imagination; improve reading proficiency; increase quality and quantity of writing; increase involvement with and attractiveness of literature.  Teachers will increase kinesthetic activities; increase experimentation with drama and student participation; increase effective teaching of reading and writing.  In a 3-year period, Wild Swan will develop a core team of skilled teachers in each school who are then able to train subsequent faculty in Books Alive methods.

The project will provide services to some of Montana's most challenged schools through a comprehensive approach that incorporates two tested interventions: 1) Solid Foundation, a program that engages parents and community members with school personnel in a process of assessing and strengthening their schools partnership model; and 2) The Parent Teacher Home Visit Project, through which schools build important family connections through strategic home visits.  In addition, the project will provide ongoing technical assistance, training, and support to partnering schools throughout the planning, implementation, and operational stages. This project meets absolute priority 4 by providing strategies and programs designed to turnaround persistently low performing schools though strengthening non-academic student supports that have been shown to increase academic gains.  It meets competitive preference priority 5 by addressing pre-school to kindergarten as a critical transition year for home visits and including the involvement of K-3 teacher and staff in critical interventions. It meets competitive priority 8 by specifically targeting schools in rural LEA's that serve high-need students including 25-50% American Indian students, with some schools well over 50%.The design of this project comes out of what has proven to be highly adaptable and effective strategies to engage parents in Montana's most isolated and poorly performing schools.

Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation,"The Development, Implementation, Scaling, Sustainability, and Evaluation of an Enhanced Dual Enrollment System",Princeton,NJ,8540,"""The proposed Enhanced Dual Enrollment System (EDES) builds upon the deep knowledge of two lead organizations, the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation and the Middle College National Consortium, both of whom have extensive experience in the development of early college high schools and supporting organizations that specialize in crucial components of the model. Early Colleges (ECs) are small high schools that serve traditionally underserved students and provide the opportunity for them to graduate from high school with an associates degree or 1-2 years of transferable college credit. The main reasons why these schools are successful are because they 1) help students prepare for college-level coursework, 2) provide dual enrollment courses (for which students earn both high school and college credit) and 3) support students in the hard work of preparing for, and doing, college-level work. This means that the schools must provide not only exemplary academics and instruction, but the appropriate feedback for students and staff to understand student progress in relation to postsecondary standards; non-academic supports (such as emotional and behavioral); and the key cognitive strategies necessary for college success. One limitation of ECs is that they are difficult to scale; the model requires small schools that, in this economic climate, are expensive to replicate. Therefore, for this project, we will apply the knowledge gained in creating and developing ECs to a much broader range of high schools by replicating the core components?the components of the work that make the most difference on students? educational trajectories?in other types of secondary schools. This will allow for a greater reach and, ultimately, this work will provide opportunities for larger numbers and percentages of underserved students enroll and succeed in postsecondary education.""",AP3: High Standards and High-Quality Assessments,CP6: College Access and Success College Access and Success,Nonprofit w/ consortium of schools,Validation,5 years,20119111,No,"Princeton, NJ

We propose to develop a training model grounded in Professional Learning Communities to help teachers use an intelligent tutoring system called ASSISTments in order to drive reform and improve student learning. The funding has been successful as ASSISTments has proven to be a valuable tool to enhance teaching. Currently ASSISTments is in schools that receive direct support from the PI and his staff. Can this invention be given to schools where the creators are not doing one-on-one training of teachers? We think we first need to develop a model for how to train schools.We propose that to develop this model we will iteratively deigns, test, and re-design this model for 4 years, making it better each year. Our model of training should be able to be used to train a number of schools effectively.

Worcester Polytechnic Institute,DATA-ASSIST - Improving Student Achievement through Online Nightly Homework,Worcester,MA,1609,"""According to the National Assessment of Educational Progress only 32% of American public school student are at or above ?proficient? in mathematics. The state of Maine is representative of this trend with only 35% of students at or above ?proficient? according to NAEP. In fact, Maine?s math achievement scores have remained flat despite being the only state in the country that leases laptops to every middle school student in the state. This lack of improvement may be due to the fact that Maine did not buy any educational software for math. We propose to remedy this by giving all 45,000 middle school students in Maine a well-developed computer-based intelligent tutoring system so students can get feedback on their homework while at the same time, their teachers get reports on how students are doing. Two rigorous studies, with high internal validity, showed that using ASSISTments for homework leads to more learning than a traditional control group where student got feedback the next day in class. Each student gets individualized help, right when they make a mistake, rather than waiting until the next day in class. The RAND Corporation, a trusted name in objective analysis, will conduct an external evaluation to see if, in fact, student test scores do go up. Initially 60 schools will participate in the randomized controlled trial. By the end of the grant, all the schools in the state will get access to access to ASSISTments. This grant is proposed by an interdisciplinary team of nationally renowned experts in cognitive science, intelligent tutoring systems, mathematics education, teacher training, educational leadership and psychometrics. The team has extensive support throughout Maine from many partners. Improving homework so that kids get immediate feedback might sound mundane to some, but cognitive science tells of the importance of immediate feedback for learning.

Zachary Community  School Board,Journey to College and Career Program,Zachary,LA,70791,"""College enrollment and persistence rates have increased for all groups in the past half-century.  However, gaps in educational attainment by race and income persist today.  Pre-collegiate outreach programs are designed to provide underserved students with additional support to prepare for and succeed in higher education.  Researchers consistently cite the need for high quality data collection and rigorous evaluations of these programs to better identify elements of effectiveness for program participants.  Evidence from the few programs that have undergone such evaluations suggests that these programs can increase access and persistence in higher education for low-income and minority students.  Successful programs generally target students early and coordinate with systemic school reform efforts.  The Zachary Community School District Journey to College and Career (JTCC) initiative aims to implement this successful program model in an effort to provide additional, rigorous research and evaluation data regarding the effectiveness of pre-collegiate academic outreach programs for all subgroups of students.""",AP3: High Standards and High-Quality Assessments,"CP5: Early Learning, CP6: College Access and Success College Access and Success, CP7: Unique Learning Needs, CP8: Rural LEAs",LEA,Development,5 years,580760,No,"Zachary, LA

"ZERO TO THREE: National Center for Infants, Toddlers and Families",Project Click-ABC,Washington,DC,20036,"""This project will serve 24 early childhood educators serving children birth to five years, within early learning programs administered by each LEA, along with 79 Kindergarten through 3rd grade teachers.   In total these teachers serve approximately 1,543 children birth to 8 years of age annually.  ZERO TO THREE and our partners will:  1) Provide high quality, intensive and interactive training and mentoring that will result in increased teacher knowledge and use of effective teaching pedagogy in supporting early language and literacy and effective literacy instruction. 2)  Support collaboration and transition activities between early learning programs that service children birth to age three, preschools, and Kindergarten through third grade classrooms. 3)  Align teacher competencies that positively effect language and literacy outcomes and achievement for teachers serving children birth to 8 years of age; 4) Develop an evaluation system to measure teacher effectiveness in nurturing language and literacy, and to identify, recognize, and reward highly effective teachers; and 5) 	Support activities targeted to engage families in nurturing early language and literacy and in K-3rd grade school curricula.  ZERO TO THREE's Cradling Literacy:  Building Teachers' Skills to Nurture Early Language and Literacy from Birth to Five (Cradling Literacy) will be used as the core content basis for training to help teachers understand the vision and philosophies of a continuum of learning that begins at birth through the end of 3rd grade.  Teachers will participate in 12 half-day trainings over the three years, and receive 6 hours a month of mentoring.  Researchers in the Department of Child and Family Studies at the University of Tennessee-Knoxville will conduct an independent evaluation that will provide both formative feedback and outcome evaluation data related to project goals and objectives.""",AP1: Effective Teachers and Principals,"CP5: Early Learning, CP8: Rural LEAs",Nonprofit w/ LEA,Development,3 years,4998023,Yes,"Washington, DC

Zion-Benton Township High School,Ensuring College Readiness and Equal Access for All,Zion,IL,60099,"""Zion-Benton Township High School District 126  is applying for an i3 Development Grant in order to support a continuation of the District's focus on improved student learning.  Three years of planning, one year in implementation, intense reflective discussion, focused staff development and extensive data analysis have guided the District's school improvement efforts thus far.   The proposed model is one that has been tested in numerous school districts for the past ten years and demonstrates it can turn around failing schools through increasing academic achievement for all students, particularly at-risk students. The ultimate District 126 outcome is to foster an environment in which students can and will grow: cognitively, affectively, and social-emotionally.  For the purpose of this grant, District 126 intends to focus first on the cognitive piece, ensuring college readiness for all , and second, on the affective and social-emotional pieces, preparing students to encounter real-world challenges in college and beyond.At the heart of this model is a rigorous core curriculum infused with scaffolded skill building that allows students additional opportunities for increased access to higher level courses as they become skill ready.  This design demands intense, focused staff development to equip teachers with better skill-sets to meet the needs of a diverse student population with ever-increasing academic and social-emotional concerns.The application for the Investing in Innovation Grant is the logical next step to accomplish instructional and learning transformations within Zion-Benton classrooms as well as increase student learning and performance.?????""",AP4: Persistently Low-Performing Schools,CP6: College Access and Success College Access and Success,LEA,Development,4 years,1981767,Yes,"Zion, IL
